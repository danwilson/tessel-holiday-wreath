=====================

Holiday Wreath that detects the next holiday and changes colors appropriately via Tessel + Neopixels

This project checks the current date and updates the colors on a Neopixel strand/board based on what is the next holiday... with the intent that it looks like an LED wreath.

Proof of Concept will have:
*October 1 - 31: Halloween (black, purple, orange)
*November 1 through the fourth Thursday: Thanksgiving (brown, yellow, orange, red... fall colors)
*After Thanksgiving until December 25: Christmas/Winter/etc. (Green, red, blue, silver)
*December 26 - January 1: New Year (silver, gold, black)
